## Introduction

This repository contains multiple Solidity smart contracts, each with unique functionalities. It serves as a reference and learning resource for developers working with Ethereum and Solidity.

## Contracts

### SimpleBank

`SimpleBank` is a basic Solidity smart contract that allows users to deposit and withdraw Ether. It keeps track of the balances of each user.

#### Features:
- Deposit Ether
- Withdraw Ether
- Check balance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with these contracts, you will need:
- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for deploying and interacting with the contracts on the Ethereum network.

### Installation

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new file for each contract (e.g., `SimpleBank.sol`, `AnotherContract.sol`) and paste the respective contract code into these files.
3. Compile the contracts using the Solidity compiler.

## Usage

### Deploying the Contracts

1. Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in Remix.
2. Select "Injected Web3" (for MetaMask) or "JavaScript VM" (for testing) as the environment.
3. Ensure the correct contract is selected in the contract dropdown.
4. Click on the "Deploy" button to deploy the contract.

### Interacting with the Contracts

#### SimpleBank

- **Deposit Ether:** Use the `deposit` function.
- **Withdraw Ether:** Use the `withdraw` function with the amount to withdraw.
- **Check Balance:** Use the `getBalance` function.
