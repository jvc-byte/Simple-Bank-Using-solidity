# JVCToken Bank

## Overview

This project includes Solidity smart contracts for a decentralized bank that operates using a custom ERC-20 token, JVCToken, as its official currency. The bank contract allows user registration, token minting, burning, ownership transfer, deposits, and withdrawals. The JVCToken contract manages token minting, transferring, and burning, and provides token-related information.

## Introduction

The JVCToken Bank is a decentralized application (dApp) where users can manage their funds using the custom ERC-20 token JVCToken. The bank supports user registration, token management (minting, burning, ownership transfer), and secure token-based transactions.

## Features

- **Custom ERC-20 Token**: JVCToken, a fully compliant ERC-20 token, used as the official currency.
- **User Management**: Register users and manage their token balances.
- **Token Minting**: Mint new tokens to the bank or other users.
- **Secure Transactions**: Safeguard deposits and withdrawals with built-in checks and balances.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**clone the repo to your Remix IDE. Check [here](https://medium.com/@jvc-byte/how-to-clone-a-github-repository-in-remix-ide-two-steps-218d820824b1) for how to clone repository on Remix IDE.

## Usage

### Deploying the Contracts

1. Deploy the contract using Remix IDE on sepolia testnet using injected provider - Metamask 

3. **Interact with the contracts:** You can interact with the contracts right there on remix IDE.

### Registering Users

- Users can register by calling the `registerUser` function in the `Bank` contract. The function automatically checks the user's token balance and records it.

### Depositing and Withdrawing Tokens

- Users can deposit tokens from their account to the bank using the `deposit` function.
- Users can withdraw tokens from the bank to their account using the `withdraw` function.
